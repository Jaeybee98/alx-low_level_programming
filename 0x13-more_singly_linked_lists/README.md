Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the C programming language: how to manipulate linked lists via printing all elements, printing nth node, inserting and deleting nodes at the beginning/ending/nth element, and freeing nodes.

Description of what each file shows:
main_test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
lists.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes
Files that start with:i
-A function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list
-A function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list
-A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list
-A function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list
-A function that frees a listint_t list
-A function that frees a listint_t list
-A function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n)
-A function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list
-A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list
-A function that inserts a new node at a given position
-A function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list
-A function that reverses a linked list
